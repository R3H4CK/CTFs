<blockquote>
Completely overhauled for 2020, RACTF (Really Awesome Capture-The-Flag) is an open source student driven CTF written from scratch with only one goal: being really awesome.  
  
This year, weâ€™re incredibly excited to be able to offer some fantastic prizes to high scoring teams courtesy of Trail of Bits, including custom designed enamel challenge coins!
